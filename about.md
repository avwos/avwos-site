  The Anti Vax Wall of Shame is a Facebook page created in 2010. There was a need for people to vent about the  absolute stupidity around the world regarding vaccine refusal, and pretty soon - we realised that there was a lot of comedy to be had out of the posts that we found and posted in the group.

  Let's face it, vaccine refusal is a dangerous business. The people that are dogmatically against vaccines are a very real threat to the population at large, they threaten the immunocompromised, new borns and the elderly. There is no excuse for this kind of willful stupidity. One way to combat this is to point and laugh at them, to make the rest of the world understand that although they are a fringe minority, they are helping to bring about the resurgence of previously controlled diseases; diseases that have the ability to seriously maim, and even kill.

  So, join as us we shame them publicly and come on over to the Facebook page and join in on the discussion. We look forward to seeing you!
