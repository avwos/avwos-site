<p>Website Media Matters reports that anti vaccine stalwart Sharyl Attkisson is having a bit of trouble telling the difference between a stuck backspace key and an actual hacker.</p>

<p>From their report on <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/10/31/computer-security-experts-attkisson-video-of-pu/201403">October 31st:</a></p>
<blockquote>Computer security experts say that a video released by former CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson appears to show her computer "malfunction[ing]," likely due to a stuck backspace key, not being hacked by government agents as she had suggested. </blockquote>
<p>To those that have been following Attkissons fall from grace from as an investigative journalist at CBS to anti vaccine crank blogger, this comes as no surprise. Anti vaxers the world over are united in their lack of understanding regarding anything technological, and indeed are prone to flights of fantasy of being watched by dark powers.</p>
<p>AVWOS recommends not eating one's lunch in front of their computer, and giving their keyboard a good clean from time to time, lest their backspace key becomes stuck...</p>
