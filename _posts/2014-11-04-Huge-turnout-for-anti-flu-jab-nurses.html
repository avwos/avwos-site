<p>"Nurses against Mandatory Vaccines" wowed the world today with a huge turnout of two people to their organised march against... vaccines. This is fifty percent more than the "Billion Toddler March", which consisted of one crazy cat lady.</p>

<p>NAMV have stated that they are thrilled at the success of the march, and if current trends hold up, they will expect four people next year.</p>
