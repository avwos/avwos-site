<p>Leslie C botha has compiled data from the completely reality based 'Truth about Gardasil' in an attempt to wake up the sheeple as to the possible adverse effects of the HPV vaccine.</p>
<p>AVWOS asked Leslie how she came up with the list.</p>
<blockquote>I asked the experts at Truth about Gardasil. They really know their stuff there. I also took every single report from VAERS and added that in. I was shocked when I saw one report that it turned a man into the Incredible Hulk, but I didn't believe it so I didn't add it in.</blockquote>
<p>She advised us as to her methodology, but it was incoherant as she was shouting.</p>
<p>Medicos the world over are extremely interested in her research, as it seems that Gardasil is the sole cause of every single one of mankinds ailments. Every. Single. One.</p>
<p>All. The. Ailments.</p>
<p>Especially "Extreme Pain in the Tailbone Area".</p>
