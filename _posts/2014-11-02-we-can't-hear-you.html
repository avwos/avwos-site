    <p>In latest news, anti vaxers claim that the louder they shout - the more real their claims.</p>
    <p>This doesn't come as a shock to many people that have been trying to talk to anti vaxers over the years. Mary O'connel of Long Beach, CA was recently admitted to hospital after enduring a five hour online conversation with such a person.</p>
    <blockquote>At first it was ok, but then I noticed the amount of capital letters were increasing, until it was all I could see. Eventually, I went blind from all the visual shouting.</blockquote>
    <p>The anti vaxer in question was reached out to for comment, but we were not able to make out what he was saying due to all the shouting.</p>
    <p>Ever since anti vaccine cranks finally figured out how to use Twitter hashtags, with the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hearthiswell&src=tyah">#hearthiswell</a> campaign, it has been noticed that the world still doesn't care and now sees the movement as even loopier than previously thought.</p>
    <p>We hear you well enough anti vaxers. It's just a shame that what you are shouting has no substance at all.</p>
