<p>Sally B Totalderp has made claims on social media recently that has left many scratching their heads. The most astounding of these claims is that unvaccinated people are more likely to be psychic and would be prone to remember past lives.<p>

<p>As well as the claims of psychic abilities by those not protected against a host of diseases, is the claim that those that have been "vaccine damaged" are also blue eyed and left handed.</p>
<p>John Trounce, a medical researcher from Argentina is thankful for this revelation:</p>
<blockquote>We have been wondering for years where blue eyes and left-handedness have come from. Now, from the intensive research by Sally, we have an answer. It's the vaccines.</blockquote>
<p>Sally advises that she has never been vaccinated. One wonders if she were psychic, why she didn't know of these side effects already?</p>
