    <p>Vactruth, a bastion of truth and arbiter of objective reality have released a devestating salvo to the medical world by way of Jim "Novax" Okelly.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive thumbnail" src="/img/screenshots/derp502.png" style="height: 50%; width: 50%;">
    <p>Late last week, Vactruth published a dialog on their Facebook page regarding germ theory from neglected Nobel hopeful Jom "Novax" Okelly. About a third of the submission is difficult to read due to the shouting, but AVWOS have been able to make out that because:</p>
    <blockquote>IF GERMS CAUSE COLDS FOR EXAMPLE (sic) AND THESE GERMS ARE EVERYWHERE, WHY AREN'T YOU SICK RIGHT NOW?</blockquote>
    <p><i>AVWOS apologies for any bleeding of the cornea experienced while reading the above quote.</i></p>
    <p>Immunologists around the world have been stumped on this question for decades. In a stunning revelation, Jim "Novax" Okelly advises:</p>
    <blockquote>If you're not sick (sic) it's because your immune system is strong, that proves that germs are not the cause... </blockquote>
    <p>Immunologists are now working with this new logic to come up with better systems in order to predict ill health.</p>
    <p>Remember, if you are not sick, it is because it isn't germs.</p>
